Hi, I'm Ashwin, an aspiring software engineer currently on the lookout for exciting opportunities in the field of Machine Learning. I enjoy building things from scratch and learning by doing, whether it's visualizing algorithms or crafting a ray tracer!

I earned my MSc from the University of Edinburgh, UK in 2025. Some of my favourite courses include Database Systems, Game Theory and Applied Machine Learning. For my dissertation, I built a web-app from scratch to visualise Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms under the supervision of [Prof. Murray Cole](https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/murray-cole). The live web-app can be accessed [here.](https://vdca.netlify.app)

Previously I worked at Standard Chartered Bank GBS as a Software Engineer where I spearheaded compliance automation for Exasol database reducing 60 minutes of daily manual effort while ensuring continuous flow of critical monitoring metadata into Splunk. Also maintained 99.88% availability of the database by limiting annual downtime (planned maintenance and unplanned outages) to less than 10 hours.

I also worked as a research intern under the guidance of [Prof. Rashmi NR](https://www.manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/rashmi-naveen-raj/_jcr_content.html). During the internship, I implemented Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for autonomous driving in TORCS simulation environment. The research work has been published in [Springer Nature](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41870-023-01412-6) and [IEEE Access](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10309299)

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer and Communication Engineering with a minor specialisation in Computational Mathematics from Manipal Institute of Technology. 
During my undergraduate studies, I was a part of National Cadet Coprs (NCC), an uniformed youth organisation of India. I served as the Senior Under Officer and was responsible for the administration and smooth functioning of a unit of 150+ cadets.
