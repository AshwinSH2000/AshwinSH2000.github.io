Hi, I'm Ashwin, MSc Computer Science graduate from the University of Edinburgh, currently on the lookout for exciting opportunities as a Software Engineer or in the field of Machine Learning. I enjoy building things from scratch and learning by doing, whether it's visualizing algorithms or crafting a ray tracer!
